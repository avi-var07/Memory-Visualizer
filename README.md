## üîç Overview

This project is an interactive visualization tool designed to simulate three core memory management techniques used in operating systems:

1. **Paging**: Demonstrates how physical memory is divided into fixed-size frames and logical memory into pages
2. **Segmentation**: Shows memory allocation with variable-sized segments based on logical divisions of programs
3. **Virtual Memory**: Illustrates the mapping between virtual and physical address spaces with on-demand loading

The simulator provides real-time visual feedback and performance metrics, making it an excellent educational resource for understanding these complex memory management concepts.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/memory-management-simulator.git
   cd memory-management-simulator
   ```

2. Create and activate virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

5. The application should automatically open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`.
